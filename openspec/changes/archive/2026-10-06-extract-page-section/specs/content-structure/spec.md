# Spec Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Page sections
A page SHALL be built from sections that span the full width of the page content area, each on either the page background or the section background. Each section's content SHALL sit in a horizontally centered container at most 72rem wide, with side padding of 1rem below the medium breakpoint (768px) and 2rem from it. Each section SHALL have vertical padding of 3rem below 768px and 4rem from it. A section SHALL contribute no content of its own: the consuming capability fills it.

#### Scenario: Centered content
- **WHEN** a page renders on a viewport wider than 72rem plus its side padding
- **THEN** the content of every section is centered with equal space on both sides, while the section backgrounds span the full width of the page content area

#### Scenario: Side and section spacing
- **WHEN** a page renders at any viewport width
- **THEN** no section content touches the side edges of the page content area, and consecutive sections touch and are separated only by their vertical padding

#### Scenario: Section background
- **WHEN** a section renders
- **THEN** its background covers the full width of the page content area and is either the page background or the section background, as the consuming page decides

#### Scenario: Consumer content only
- **WHEN** a consuming capability fills a section
- **THEN** the rendered content is exactly what the consumer supplied, and the section adds no text or data of its own
